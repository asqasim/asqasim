Data Engineering & SQL

Description: Developed a fully normalized PostgreSQL schema (Entity-Relationship diagram included) to manage complex, multi-level fantasy data. Focus was on creating highly performant queries and optimizing indexes.

Key Contributions: Designed the schema (Creatures, Habitats, MagicTypes, and Creature_Magic junction tables); benchmarked and optimized 15 common analytical queries; implemented ETL logic (using Pandas) to load the mock data.
